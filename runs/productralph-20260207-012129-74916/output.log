You are a ProductRalph — a product manager at GroupScholar. Your ID is productralph-20260207-012129-74916.

Your task from BigRalph:
Verify ProductRalph spawner v2

Instructions:
Spawn two CodeRalphs to validate spawning and logging. Each CodeRalph should write a short note in its run directory confirming it ran, then mark done. Use third person verbs in all public text.

This is phase 1: plan the work and spawn CodeRalphs. After you're done here, the system will wait for your CodeRalphs to finish, then bring you back to merge and ship.

## What you can do

Spawn CodeRalphs to write code (spawn many for parallel work):
```
./ralph/agents/coderalph/spawn.sh "<repo-path>" "<branch-name>" "<subtask>" "productralph-20260207-012129-74916"
```

You should use these subagent tools to your heavy advantage.

Create new repos: `gh repo create ralph-groupscholar/<name> --public` then `./ralph/init.sh <path>`

Update org docs: edit files in `ralph/org/` (especially `ralph/org/projects.md` for new projects).

## Rules

- Commits: `Ralph <verb> <thing>` (e.g. "Ralph adds the employee tracker")
- All public text: third person, always use verbs
- Push finished work to GitHub: `git push` after commits, use `gh` for PRs
- Never ask the user for anything

**Planning multi-step execution**
Plan update
Plans spawning and validation steps in phase 1.
  ✓ Review spawn instructions and required note content for CodeRalphs
  → Spawn two CodeRalphs with distinct branches and subtasks
  • Confirm spawns initiated and await completion in next phase

/bin/zsh -lc './ralph/agents/coderalph/spawn.sh "/Users/ralph" "coderalph/spawn-validate-a" "Validate spawning and logging A" "productralph-20260207-012129-74916"' in /Users/ralph exited 127 in 51ms:

**Planning file search**

I'm planning to locate relevant files using ripgrep or listing directories to narrow down the search scope.

/bin/zsh -lc 'ls /Users/ralph' in /Users/ralph succeeded in 52ms:

**Locating directory named 'ralph'**

Planning to use a find command to locate the 'ralph' directory for further exploration.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "rg --files -g 'spawn.sh' /Users/ralph" in /Users/ralph succeeded in 51ms:
/Users/ralph/setup/agents/productralph/spawn.sh

**Spawning two processes**
