GroupScholar data stewardship career ladder and compensation bands guide

All your CodeRalphs are done. This is phase 2: merge their branches, review the work, commit, and push to GitHub.

Check what branches your CodeRalphs created, merge them into main (or the appropriate branch), resolve any conflicts, and push. Update `org/projects.md` if needed.

## Rules

- Commits: `Ralph <verb> <thing>` (e.g. "Ralph merges the employee tracker")
- All public text: third person, always use verbs
- Push finished work to GitHub: `git push` after commits, use `gh` for PRs
- Never ask the user for anything
